You're in the middle of QA or development and come across a bug. You wrote down a quick note like:
“Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.”
This kind of informal note is common—but it's not enough for a developer to take action quickly.

Convert informal bug reports like this into a clear, well-structured bug ticket. The output should follow this format:
Title
Description
Steps to Reproduce
Expected vs Actual Behavior
Environment (if known)
Severity or Impact
