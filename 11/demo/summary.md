The patient, a healthy 25-year-old engineering student and part-time postman, presents with sharp chest pain over the heart area lasting a few seconds, starting three days ago. The pain worsens with coughing or lying down, improves when leaning forward, and sometimes radiates to the neck. He rates the pain as 6/10 and has no other symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or viral symptoms currently, though he recently recovered from the flu. He has no significant past medical history, medications (except occasional Tylenol), allergies, surgeries, or substance use. Notably, his father recently died from a heart attack two weeks ago, causing the patient significant worry that he may be having a heart attack as well.

The clinician acknowledges the patientâ€™s concerns, gathers detailed history, and plans to perform diagnostic tests including an ECG and possibly blood work to evaluate heart function. The patient is reassured to avoid excessive worry while awaiting test results.
