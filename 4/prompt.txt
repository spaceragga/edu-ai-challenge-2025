      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
```
